# RackM8
## Fall 17 CS 465 - User Interface Design Final Project

Video Introduction : https://youtu.be/mZ3_xzuH-rE

RackM8 is an Android application that enables users to search for bicycle racks based on academic buildings. For the scope of our project, this app includes racks and buildings on the UIUC engineering quad.

## Project Guidelines
- The project must primarily address an interface design problem. This is not the place to focus on algorithms or database solutions for which the interface is well-known or obvious. It is also best to avoid well-known problems which have been addressed many times over. Showing the locations of friends on a map, course planners, course schedulers, study team organizers, to-do lists, restaurant, menu, and recipe interfaces, and chat interfaces all fall into this category and should be avoided.

- The project must be suitable for the task-centered design approach we will learn in the course. That rules out most applications where users interact without specific goals or tasks to accomplish. For example, a purely decorative screen-saver would not fit. Game-related applications should be reviewed carefully. We will help you determine whether a project is likely to work well, and we can often help you identify an aspect of a domain that interests you that would be suitable.

- The project should be relatively self-contained and scoped appropriately for the course. You will have only a few weeks to perform the implementation. It is therefore best if the project delves deep into a small problem as opposed to trying to build a large application. It is acceptable to simulate aspects of a project that cannot be feasibly implemented. It is typically unnecessary to manage a live database or use real sensors for input. In general, you should avoid working on the "system side" of the project.
